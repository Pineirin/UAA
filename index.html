            <h2>Welcome, dear visitor</h2>
            <p>
                Openings are one of the most important parts of Age of Empires II's "gameplay", they are a series of
                optimized ways for developing your economy and military setups.
                Every player that wants to achieve a proficient skill in Age of Empires II must know and practice, at
                least, a few openings, to be able to defeat it's opponents.
                The reason behind this is that, in Age of Empires II, small early game advantages will transfer (most of
                the time) into big advantages as the game goes on. So, being able to outproduce your opponent, using the
                most optimized early strategy, will increase exponentially your odds of winning the game.
                Alongside this web page, you will be taught in the most common opening strategies in the competitive
                maps of Age of Empires II.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to obtain a good use of this guide, you should have a basic knowledge of Age of Empires II's
                basic mechanics.
                Also, you are expected to know the most basic concepts of the game such as: gathering from sheep, luring
                a bore and scouting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, if you follow this guide, there are several rules you must apply regardless of the opening you are using.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always keep your town center producing or researching, never idle.</li>
                <li>If you are told to enqueue a unit, without specifying quantity, make sure you're always enqueuing that unit as long as you have resources (unless you reach imperial age).</li>
                <li>Unless specified otherwise, select as rally point for villagers a forest near a lumber camp and as rally point for fishing ship a fish bank.</li>
                <li>If you have an excess of wood send villagers from wood to build farms, mine gold or mine stone.</li>
                <li>If you want to gather food from sheep, keep always two sheep (death or alive) in the center of the town center, gather food from those sheep.</li>
                <li>If you want to lure a boar, guide him to the town center and hunt and him there with the villagers that are gathering ship, gather the food from the boar with the hunters and from the sheep with the villager that lured the boar.</li>
            </ul>
